# Image-Splitter
Image splitter in Java: split images into smaller ones. No additional dependencies/libraries needed.
It works both with Swing and JavaFX, and even with other libraries, since it only uses arrays and collections. 

It could be specially helpful for those who are developing 2D games and have to separate a spritesheet into different sprites.

It has three different split modes:
- Split by grid (columns and rows).
- Split by fixed width and height.
- Split automatically based on pixel colors. This is the most powerful and flexible one.
